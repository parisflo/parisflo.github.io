Thanks for stopping by â€“ I'm always really touched when people express an interest in my scientific output. This website primarily functions as a repository for my work and is laid out in the style of a typical academic website (hopefully the lack of creativity enhances the navigability). Currently I'm a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> developing ideas involving algorithmic information theory and learning algorithms.
